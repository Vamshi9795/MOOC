Generally, any year that is divisible by four is a leap year. However, if the year is additionally divisible by 100, it is a leap year only if it also divisible by 400.

Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and then prints out whether that year is a leap year or not.

Some examples:

Sample output
Please type in a year: 2011
That year is not a leap year.
Sample output

That year is a leap year.
Sample output
Please type in a year: 1800
That year is not a leap year.
